# Neuro-Isochrone Accessibility Explorer

This repository hosts an interactive GitHub Pages site for exploring driving-time-based accessibility to stroke care across Germany. In some regions, it may be faster to drive to the nearest hospital rather than the next certified stroke unit once a stroke is suspected. This analysis calculates isochrone maps, driving times, and local differences at both county and state levels.

For a detailed methodology and full results, see:
Masanneck et al. (2025), "XXX Placeholder", DOI: [XXXX](https://doi.org/XXXX).

## Repository structure

- `docs/` — GitHub Pages root
  - `index.html` — interactive explorer UI
  - `Results/Counties/` — county-level isochrones, Excel, PDF, and `meta.json`
  - `Results/States/` — state-level isochrones, Excel, PDF, and `meta.json`

## Usage

Simply  click through the site tabs to explore county vs. state accessibility maps and download data. Data can also be directly accessed via the Results folder. Further relevant information can be found in the publication.
